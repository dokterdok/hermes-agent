"""Legacy-handler fallback for authority-backed WebSocket connections.

Session verbs live on the session authority; methods it answers ``-32601`` for may still have a
legacy sidecar handler (pet, wake word, connectors, config). That fallback must not widen what
the connection's ticket grants (R2-M3):

* only connections holding the authority's full interactive grant reach legacy dispatch — a
  worker-adoption ticket (``{'worker:adopt'}``) or a capability-less connection keeps the
  authority's ``-32601``;
* a ticket bound to a secondary profile keeps that profile's scope: sessionless
  ``@_profile_scoped`` handlers read :func:`connection_profile_home` instead of defaulting to the
  launch profile.
