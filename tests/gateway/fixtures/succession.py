"""Several gateway identities in one process, each with its own root, room store and Runs store.

``Gateway.acting()`` switches the process to that gateway's HERMES_HOME, so its RoomLink secret,
installation id and room identity key are the real ones derived from that root. Rooms, copies,
custody and fences use the production stores; the network between gateways is a direct call to
the real handler, made as the gateway that answers.
