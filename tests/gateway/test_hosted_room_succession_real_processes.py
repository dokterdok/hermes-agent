"""Three real gateways in majority mode: the host is killed and a standby takes the group over by itself.

H hosts a Group Chat with two local Bots and one Bot each on S and T. S and T both keep copies
and consent to continue it; the owner designated them in that order, and each says it is always on (``group_chat.always_on``),
so the voters are [H, S, T] and the group moves by itself. Every exchange between
the three is real HTTP between separate processes, each with its own ``HERMES_HOME``.

Once the configuration has settled and H holds its lease, a send comes back ``protected`` and H's Bot
takes the turn. H is then killed (SIGKILL): after the turn settled and every voter holds the whole log,
or mid-turn. A global observer polls every live computer's public status twice a second for the
whole run: at no observed instant may two computers admit work, nor at two different epochs. A
standby must take over within the bound (the ~20 s lease, 10 s grace, then promises and catch-up)
with a certified, automatic move; its history holds the protected message and the turn's admission,
and the other standby follows it. H then restarts: it refuses work, rejoins as a copy of the new
host, and never serves. H's turn runs once, never again there or anywhere else. With H still down, both
available Bots answer fresh addressed messages under the new authority, each exactly once.

Real timing: about 80 s of wall clock per case, like the other daemon tests' grant renewal waits.
