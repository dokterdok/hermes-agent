"""Cross-process falsification of the per-session fence.

The unit tests share one interpreter, so they cannot see the failure this whole
change exists to prevent: two SEPARATE gateway processes, each with its own
snapshot of a conversation, both writing to it. That is how the defect was found
and it is the only way to prove it is closed.

Run against the fork's own HERMES_HOME so nothing here touches a real profile:

    python scripts/probe_active_session_exclusivity.py

It drives real ``python -m tui_gateway.entry`` processes over stdio JSON-RPC.
The standalone entry now reserves the home's ``gateway.lock`` (the gateway's own
owner reservation) before it opens ``state.db``, so the second writer is refused
before it exists rather than per turn:

    A  create S, submit          -> claims the session
    B  start on the same home    -> refused at startup (exit 1), never ready
    A  exits                     -> its reservation dies with it
    B  start, resume S, submit   -> succeeds

No provider is required. The fence is checked BEFORE the agent is built, so a
submit that later fails for want of a model still proves who owns the session --
which is the property under test, and keeps the probe free of credentials and of
inference cost.
