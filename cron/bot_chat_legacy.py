"""Upgrade path for ``cron/bot_chat_pending`` records the retired CLI lane left behind.

The old lane parked never-started Bot Chat outputs there for a later tick to replay
through ``hermes chat``. That consumer is gone; each still-``queued`` record is handed,
under its own id, to the target profile's live owner through the canonical
``tools.bot_live_delivery.deliver_to_live_owner`` door (idempotent per id). Records are
never deleted: they keep their final status as evidence, exactly as the old drain did.
A ``claimed`` record was an uncertain CLI turn and is never resent.
