"""One-shot import of the pre-isolation ``hosted_room*`` rows into ``shared-state.db``.

``0e422e0ece`` repointed the room store from the root ``state.db`` to ``shared-state.db`` without
moving the rows it already held, so an install that had rooms started with an empty coordination
set and every pre-existing room resolved to "hosted room not found" (#109775). The first open after
the upgrade copies the rows across once; the marker row keeps that a one-shot step, because a purge
in THIS store must never be undone by re-importing rows the legacy store still holds.
