"""Continuing a Group Chat on this computer: preview, continue, and keep after a conflict.

``preview`` checks, without changing anything, what continuing here would mean: how far this
copy is behind the most complete reachable one, which work is finished, still running elsewhere,
unknown or waiting for the old host, and which Bots stay unavailable. ``continue_here`` then runs
the owner's decision: it fences the host's epoch at every reachable backup, adopts the most
complete copy, writes the marked transition, records the next configuration, reconciles accepted
work, takes ownership, registers the members' continuation routes, and announces the move. Each
step is recorded, so a crash resumes instead of repeating one, and a failed attempt keeps its
reason.

When two computers hosted the group at once (a partition and two moves), the first contact between
them records ``continued_on_two``. The group keeps running on one of them by rule: the higher
epoch, and on a tie ``certified`` before ``evidence`` before ``attested``, then the lower
installation id. That host keeps serving (on a tie it continues at a fresh epoch every computer can
follow), every copy follows it, and the other host stops serving with its own messages kept apart
until the owner chooses. ``keep`` from either side: keeping the running host steps the other one
down to a copy, its messages set aside; keeping the other one switches, at a fresh epoch, and the
running host steps aside. The owner's choice is signed by the computer it was made on.
