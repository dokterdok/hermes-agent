"""Handing a Group Chat over on purpose: the host signs its exact history over to a standby.

The owner moves a group while its host is up (``groups.succession.move``), a gateway that stops
or quits without restarting hands its groups over first, and Desktop's sleep hook asks for the
same (``groups.succession.handover_all``). In every case:

1. The host stops admitting: the group pauses here, so its history is final.
2. It signs ``{room_id, from_epoch, to_epoch, successor, last_seq, last_hash}`` with its room
   identity key (proof kind ``handover``): exactly this history, ending at ``last_seq`` whose
   custody chain hash is ``last_hash``, goes to that computer.
3. The standby catches up to ``last_seq`` from the host if it must, checks the signature with the
   host's pinned key and its own copy against ``last_seq`` and ``last_hash``, fences the host's
   epoch at every computer it reaches (each verifies the statement and gives back the host's
   lease), writes the marked transition (``reason: handover``) and finishes like any continuation.
4. The host steps down to a copy that follows the standby; nothing is set aside.

If the host vanishes before step 2, nothing moved, and the lease or the manual path applies. Once
the statement may have left, the host stays paused until it follows the standby or completes the
same handover. A failed reply or an earlier query cannot recall a delayed signed statement.
