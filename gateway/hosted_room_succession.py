"""Continuing a Group Chat on another computer after its host is lost: proofs, receipts and records.

A group moves to another computer in one of four ways (``website/docs/developer-guide/
group-chat-host-loss.md``), each with its own proof kind:

- ``attested``: the owner continues the group on one eligible computer by hand;
- ``certified``: in majority mode a standby takes over by itself once a majority of the voters
  promised it, each only after its lease to the old host ran out;
- ``evidence``: with exactly two voters, the standby takes over after the careful silence and
  signs what it observed;
- ``handover``: the host itself signs its exact history over (a stop, Desktop's sleep hook, or the
  owner's move).

Eligible means ``successor: true`` in the room's custody configuration: one of the owner's own
computers, or a member the owner designated whose own operator consented. Every move fences the
host's epoch at every computer it reaches. Each answers with a signed fence receipt
(``fence_and_promise`` in #105079: one successor per epoch, never revoked), its watermark, its
evidence of the room's runs and, where its operator pre-consented, fresh grants for its members.
The successor adopts the most complete copy and writes one ``authority.transition`` with the proof
and the receipts. Every other computer verifies that proof itself before its copy follows.

This module holds the formats, their verification against the room's own configuration, and the
durable records: per-room succession state, the lineage an installation learned, and
continuation consent. Custody, room identity keys and the verified mark belong to #104601 and
#99107 and are reached through the adapters below.
