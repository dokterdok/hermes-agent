"""A backup's side of continuing a Group Chat: fence receipts, announcements, queries and reports.

Every request is signed with the caller's room identity key, which this installation pins from
the room's own custody configuration. ``answer_fence`` fences the host's epoch here and promises
the next one to the requesting successor (one successor per epoch, #105079), then answers with a
signed receipt, sealed to the successor because it carries run evidence and continuation grants.
``answer_learn`` takes a successor's verified transition: this computer follows it, sets aside
whatever it holds beyond the shared history first, or reports a conflict when it follows another
successor at that epoch. ``answer_query`` tells any configured computer who this copy follows,
which also serves as the heartbeat backups use to notice an offline host.
