"""What a computer knows about its group's host, as ``groups.succession.status`` reports it, and the upkeep
behind it.

``status`` answers ``groups.succession.status`` from this computer's own records: the room it
hosts or the copy it keeps, the configuration, its custody view, and the heartbeat record the
upkeep keeps. A backup asks the configured host every minute (the signed succession query); the
host counts as offline only after a bounded window without an answer, never after one missed
poll, and a planned restart the host announced is not loss. Every field is a code or parameter;
times are Unix seconds.

When the host stays offline, the eligible computer best placed to continue the group (ranked as
``actions[continue].targets``) sends the owner one notice per incident: through the owner's
private chats when messaging offers them, otherwise the home channel. Another eligible computer
waits five minutes and sends only while every better-placed one still looks offline from here.
