"""Room-id reservations, quarantine and shared retention guards for hosted Group Chat stores.

Installed on every room store, the legacy ``shared-state.db`` and each canonical ``state.db``:

* ``hosted_room_quarantine`` keeps a room read-only, and out of pruning, once its history records a
  takeover no exclusive authority proved (an ``authority.claimed`` promoted from a replica, or an
  unmarked ``authority.lost`` or ``authority.transition``), or once one room id names both a local
  room and a stored copy.
* ``hosted_room_verified_transitions`` marks the authority changes exclusive-authority recovery
  verified. A mark admits exactly one authority-change event, in its own transaction (see
  ``mark_verified_transition``); a mark set aside with its event's divergent branch is archived in
  ``hosted_room_branch_transitions``, never deleted.
* ``hosted_room_id_reservations`` binds every room id to the kind that first used it, even after its
  payload is pruned, so a copied room is never recreated as a local one.
* ``hosted_room_event_budget`` counts room and replica events against one byte budget.

A quarantined room never becomes writable again. The one change it accepts is an operator-confirmed
Disband on this gateway (``hosted_room_quarantine_disbands``): a tombstone that appends nothing to its
history and leaves its authority untouched. Its rows and events can't be deleted, so no pruning, not even
an older process's, removes that evidence.

The guards are SQLite triggers, so they also hold for writers that predate them, such as an older
gateway process still sharing the store.
