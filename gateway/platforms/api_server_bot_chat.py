"""Peer turns into the canonical Bot Chat under session authority.

``hermes peer dm`` (``/api/sessions/{id}/chat[/stream]``) and ``hermes peer run`` (``/v1/runs``)
aim at the profile's Bot Chat. Under session authority that chat is a LOCAL session whose only
writer is the authority FIFO — a Desktop showing it is a viewer, never a lease-holding executor —
so the API edge admits the turn through the same door as ``bot_relay.deliver``
(``gateway/session_bot.py``) and reads the reply from that admission's receipt. Binding the
session as an API conversation (``run_api_turn``) would be a second writer and is refused
(``permission_denied``) by design. Without an authority the legacy live-owner mailbox applies.
