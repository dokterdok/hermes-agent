"""Group Chat succession endpoints between a group's computers, authenticated by room identity keys.

``POST /v1/room-members/succession/fence`` fences the group's old epoch here and promises the next
one to the computer continuing it (``gateway/hosted_room_succession_backup.py``). ``.../learn``
takes a successor's verified transition, ``.../query`` tells any configured computer whom this copy
follows (backups use it as the host's heartbeat), ``.../report`` keeps a returning host's evidence
at the successor, and ``.../decision`` carries the owner's choice after ``continued_on_two``.
Requests are signed with the caller's pinned room identity key; fence and learn replies are sealed
to the caller, because they carry run evidence and continuation grants. No room grant is involved:
the old host's grants may be gone, and a successor never had one here. Calls use the default profile.
