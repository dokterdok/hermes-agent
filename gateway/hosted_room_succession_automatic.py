"""Moving a Group Chat by itself when its host goes offline: the host's lease, a standby's takeover,
careful mode for two voters, and continuing a paused host anyway.

The group's voters are its host and its always-on successors in the owner's order (#104601's
``custody.configured``); their number sets the mode (``mode_of``): ``majority`` with three or more,
``careful`` with exactly two and explicit risk consent, and ``ask`` otherwise.
``ask`` never moves by itself: the owner continues by hand (``hosted_room_succession_move``).

**Majority.** The host asks for a lease with each push to a voter, about every five seconds, and a
voter grants ``LEASE_SECONDS`` on its sleep-counting clock: until then it promises no later epoch to
anyone (#105079). The host counts each grant from the moment it asked, less drift and a margin, and
admits, dispatches and appends only while it holds grants from a majority of every current voter
set, itself included; a gap in its heartbeats or a detected sleep voids them all. Without that
majority it pauses to stay safe (``lost_majority``). A standby that has heard nothing from the host
for the lease and ``TRIGGER_GRACE_SECONDS``, then its rank's delay and some jitter, first asks the
voters whether they would promise; only when a majority would does it ask for promises, sign a
certificate of them (proof ``certified``), catch up from the most complete promiser and continue
(``reason: automatic``). Any two majorities share a voter, and that voter's lease or promise stops
the other side, so two hosts never admit at the same time.

**Careful (two voters).** The standby moves only after hearing nothing from the host, and the host
nothing from it, for ``CAREFUL_SILENCE_SECONDS`` in both directions, while it passes its own online
check and no restart window is open. It signs that evidence (proof ``evidence``). The host pauses
(``isolated``) once it has heard nothing from the standby for half that time and fails its own
online check. A host that kept writing anyway finds ``continued_on_two`` when the two meet: the
owner keeps one history, and the other one is set aside.

**Continue anyway.** On a paused host, the owner may continue the group there regardless: a fresh
epoch at every computer it reaches, attested by the owner, served without a lease until a majority
answers again.
