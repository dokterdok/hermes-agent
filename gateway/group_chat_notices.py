"""Tell a group's owner, unasked, when the group moved or paused by itself, or ran on two computers.

Automatic takeover is invisible when it works. These still reach the owner, once per incident:

* "“Research” moved to Home VPS because Mac mini went offline. It’s running." ("was shutting
  down" for a handover; Bots that stay on the old host are counted), from the computer the
  group moved to;
* after a careful move, where the old host's silence was the only proof, a warning instead,
  offering Keep going on Home VPS, Go back to Mac mini (confirmed first) and Ask me first
  next time;
* "“Research” is paused to stay safe: Mac mini can’t reach Home VPS.", from the paused host;
* "“Research” ran on both Mac mini and Home VPS …", offering Keep going on the computer still
  running it and Keep on the other one, from the computer the careful move went to.

A supervised gateway watcher finds them the way every client does, through the canonical
``groups.*`` methods as each room's recorded owner, on gateways that list
``groups.succession.status``: new ``authority.transition`` events in the room log, and the
status of the rooms this computer hosts, because a paused host can't write to its log. On its
first look at a room it still tells a move to this computer from the last ten minutes; older
history never notifies. What the owner was told is saved before anything is sent, so nothing
is told twice.

Each notice goes to the owner's main channel: their home channel (``/sethome``) when it is one
of their private group-control chats, otherwise each of those private chats, and only when
they have none, a one-to-one home channel, without controls. Shared chats never get them.
The choices are durable buttons where the chat has them, else typed ``/group`` commands
(``gateway.group_chat_actions``); they act only through the owner's private grant, rechecked
when used. The gateway's own "your group is paused" incident reaches the owner the same way,
through ``notify``.
