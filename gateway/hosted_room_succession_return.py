"""Stepping down: a returning old host, or the successor the owner did not keep, becomes a backup.

The old host asks the group's other computers who they follow (``.../succession/query``). Once one
shows a verified transition out of its own epoch, it steps down with ``demote_to_custody``. A
successor the owner did not keep after ``continued_on_two`` steps down the same way, in favour of
the kept one. In one writer transaction the events after the shared history move into a
divergent branch kept here, set aside and readable (``groups.succession.branch_log``); the shared
prefix becomes a custody copy that follows the kept host; the room's driver, link and policy state
goes; and a stepped-down successor's own transition mark is archived with its branch. Catch-up
then brings in the kept host's history, whose transition the copy verifies itself.

A host that learns its epoch was fenced elsewhere pauses at once and executes nothing until it can
step down. Afterwards it reports what it did while partitioned (its driver's turns and an index of
the set-aside events) to the kept host, which keeps the report beside its own reconciliation.
Nothing from a branch is merged, replayed or re-executed.
