"""Room-epoch fences and one-promise-per-epoch records for Group Chat succession.

A participant gateway keeps one succession record per room: the highest room authority
epoch it has fenced, the latest promise it made, and the latest verified authority it learned.
Each epoch is promised at most once, to one candidate installation, and a promise is never
revoked: a later candidate can only ask for a later epoch, which fences the earlier one too.
Once epoch N is fenced here, this gateway refuses new room-grant work stamped with an epoch at
or below N. Runs it admitted before keep executing and stay readable, and their Status and Stop
pass to the promised successor, or to the verified authority once one is learned for an epoch
at least as late (a candidate that lost to a certified successor never gains control).

The record lives in the durable Runs store beside the owner's participant freezes
(``group_run_freezes``), so a fence and a run admission are ordered by one SQLite writer.
The owner freeze stays a separate, permanent, single-scope record. SQL guards keep the
record monotonic and back the admission check for every writer that shares the store.

A voting computer of a group in automatic mode also grants the group's host a short lease
(``grant_lease``): while it runs, this gateway promises no later epoch to anyone
(``room_lease_active``), so a majority of promises can only form once the host's majority of
leases has run out. Leases are measured on a clock that keeps counting while the computer sleeps
(``gateway/hosted_room_clock.py``) and survive restarts. That clock starts near zero at boot, so
after a reboot a lease counts as running for its full length less the time since the new boot:
never shorter than it really ran, and never measured on the wall clock, which can be stepped.
