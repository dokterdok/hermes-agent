"""Custody of a Group Chat's history: custodians, successors, voters, watermarks and protection.

Every member installation that keeps its copy (``replicate``), and any custodian-only installation
the room owner added, is a custodian: it holds the room's whole history. The room's custodians are
a log event, ``custody.configured``, carrying each one's pinned room identity key, endpoint, display
name, whether it may continue the group (``successor``: only when its own operator consented, grant
permission ``successor``, and the room owner designated it) and whether it is always on (it reports
having no battery, or its operator says so). No member is ever picked by an algorithm.

The voters are the host and its always-on successors, at most ``MAX_VOTERS``, in the owner's order
of designation. They decide whether the group may move by itself (``mode``): ``majority`` with three
or more voters, ``careful`` with exactly two, and ``ask`` otherwise or when the owner switched
``automatic`` off. Voters change one at a time: each change is a configuration that a majority of
both the old and the new voters store before the next one, so no two majorities ever disagree.

Each copy, and the authority's own room, has a durable watermark ``(epoch, seq, event_hash)``:
``event_hash`` chains every event of that exact prefix. Custodians acknowledge each page with it, and
the authority keeps the acknowledgments that match its own chain. With every page and heartbeat the
host also sends a **head** it signs, ``{room_id, host, epoch, seq, chain_hash}``, and each custodian
keeps the latest head that vouches for its copy; a host that continues its own group at a fresh epoch
keeps its own last head of the epoch it leaves. Copies pass history between themselves only as far
as such a head vouches for it, so no custodian can add to the group's history, keys or voters.
``protected_seq`` is the highest seq a majority of voters durably holds, counting the host;
``at_risk_after_seq`` is the highest seq at least one successor holds. In majority mode sends and
dispatch wait for protection; otherwise nothing waits for a copy and later events are shown at risk.
A task made ready for dispatch is announced with ``task.admitted`` in the same transaction, so a
successor can reconcile it.

The lease layer (#105197) plugs in through ``register_lease_hooks``: the host's
``lease_request_provider`` adds a lease request to each push to a voter; a custodian hands every push
it stored from the host it follows to ``lease_grant_hook`` (any push is contact) and returns its
answer to a lease request; the host gives that answer to ``lease_ack_hook``;
``lease_remaining_provider`` bounds a send's wait; and ``serving_provider`` pauses the host. Without
the lease layer's answer a host in majority or careful mode appends nothing, and where its code isn't
installed a host offers no automatic moves at all.
