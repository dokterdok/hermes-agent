"""Canonical peer routes: one current grant per member, renewed before it expires, and
replaced grants retired at once.

A route is persisted, then published. A registration that replaces a member's grant first
revokes the old grant exactly on the member's gateway; if that cannot be confirmed, nothing
changes and the operator can retry. A renewal retires the grant it replaced as soon as the
renewed one is live; the replaced grant was about to expire anyway.

During one attempt, ``CanonicalPeerClient`` keeps the attempt on that route:

- new work (dispatch, recovery replay, probe) is sent only with the route's current grant, so
  a transport resolved before a re-registration is refused before anything is sent;
- reads, Stop and approvals of accepted work follow the current grant of the same route, since
  the grant the attempt started with may have been retired meanwhile;
- a health report applies only while the grant it was made with is still current.

``maintain_peer_grants`` renews each room's grants inside that room's own driver cycle, within
a small per-cycle budget, so a member keeps working until the horizon its gateway's operator
chose at invitation (``status_ttl_seconds``), without being invited again.
