"""Session-runtime lifecycle owned by the ordinary gateway bootstrap.

One SessionAuthority per reserved profile home. The launch home always has one; under
``gateway.multiplex_profiles`` every served secondary gets its own, built under that
profile's runtime scope against that profile's ``state.db``. ``runner.session_authority``
stays the launch profile's authority so single-profile behaviour is byte-identical.

The served set is not frozen at boot: ``serve_profile_runtime`` / ``unserve_profile_runtime``
grow and shrink it for the hot-serve reconcile, and a secondary whose store cannot be opened
is parked (logged, left out of ``served_profiles``) instead of aborting every other profile.
