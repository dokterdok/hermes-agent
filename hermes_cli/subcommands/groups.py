"""``hermes groups`` — a Group Chat whose host went offline: status, continue, keep, move and backup copies.

Thin wrappers over this computer's gateway (``groups.succession.*`` and ``groups.custody.*``).
``continue`` always runs on the computer the group should continue on: this one; ``move`` runs on the
host and hands the group over. The words are the product's own: the host, a backup copy, continue
the group.
