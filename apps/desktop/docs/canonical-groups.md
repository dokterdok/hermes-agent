# Gateway-owned groups in Desktop

Bot Mode lists gateway rooms separately from classic rooms, which Desktop runs itself. **Refresh gateway groups** reloads the canonical room list for the selected connection and profile. Opening a room captures that exact authority; changing the foreground profile does not retarget its controls.

## Which rooms are gateway rooms

One classifier (`groupExecutionMode`) decides from `groups.capabilities`. A connection is canonical only when its `methods` include `groups.discard`, and it can run rooms only when `driver` is `true`. A `-32601` reply, or any other capability payload (current `main`, standalone `hermes serve` or `hermes dashboard`), means classic rooms. A transport error shows the driver as unavailable with **Retry now**, but a connection already classified classic in this session keeps its classic composer.

The connection kind plays no part in this choice. Today only Desktop's local gateway connection advertises the canonical surface: SSH, URL remotes and Nous Cloud reach the standalone web server, which answers with the legacy surface, so their rooms stay classic until a remote endpoint advertises the canonical methods.

On a canonical connection the creation dialog creates a gateway group when the roster qualifies: two to six members, all on this connection, with unique profiles and non-reserved handles. Other rosters are created as classic rooms, and the dialog says why. On a default install the gateway refuses members that are not listed under `hosted_rooms.profiles`; the dialog explains this and links the hosted profile guide.

An existing classic room whose roster qualifies offers **Start gateway group**, which starts a new gateway room and deliberately does not replay the classic history. A classic room whose roster does not qualify keeps its classic composer.

## The room workspace

The gateway owns the log and the work. Desktop reads `groups.state`, and reads `groups.log` incrementally from the last seen `seq`, starting again from the beginning when the room's `authority_epoch` changes. It polls every two seconds while the room is visible and pauses while it is hidden.

- **Status** comes only from `driver_status`: working, idle or driver stopped, plus blocked, approvals waiting and members that need attention. A member whose turn failed or was deferred is listed beside the live status and never replaces it.
- **Send** records its event id and attempted state before calling `groups.send`. Desktop uses the native prepared-submission journal with a stable window owner and exact compare-and-set; the browser-only fallback requires Web Locks and guarantees reload recovery, not process-crash safety. Missing native support refuses Send rather than falling back to weaker storage. A first-attempt refusal with `invalid_params`, `permission_denied`, `unknown_execution` or `stale_generation` hands the text back for editing. Once an attempt is uncertain, later refusals keep the original entry for **Retry**, which resends the same event id. Acceptance requires the matching event id and either an absent legacy `accepted` field or `accepted: true`. A failed Send only returns to the group it was sent from. Another window's pending message is offered through **Restore draft**, which preserves its original identity and text without sending it or replacing an occupied composer.
- **Stop** (`groups.stop`) has its own busy state, so it works while a Send is pending, and reports how many tasks it stopped.
- **Retry, Discard and approvals** come only from `driver_status.pending_actions` and send the exact member, task, generation and request identity. Discard requires confirmation that prior side effects are not undone.
- **Attachments** upload with `groups.attachment.upload` and download with `groups.attachment.download`.
- **Files** lists the room's shared files with `groups.attachment.list`, newest first, eight per page. Search matches file names and who shared them. Each row is one exact version, so files with the same name stay separate rows, told apart by sharer, size and time to the second. **Download** fetches that version with `groups.attachment.download` and saves it only when its size and SHA-256 match. Older pages continue from the first page's snapshot; if the gateway refuses the cursor, **Show latest** starts again. Files appears only when the gateway advertises `groups.attachment.list`.
- **Rename** (`groups.rename`) keeps one event id per intended name across retries. **Disband** (`groups.disband`) asks for confirmation, and only a confirmed tombstone removes the room from Desktop and closes its tab. Both appear only when the gateway advertises them.

Bookkeeping events with nothing to show stay out of the history: `turn.settled`, `room.activity`, `task.admitted`, `custody.configured` and `succession.state`. When a group moves to another computer, Desktop words the `authority.transition` notice and a `turn.deferred` that is `waiting_for_host` in the reader's language from their display fields (`to_name`, `from_name`, `offline_since`, `resource`, `host_name`), with generic wording when a name is unknown. An older gateway's English `text` remains the fallback. This needs no extra reads.

Errors stay visible, and no failed gateway-room action falls back to Desktop-run execution. Membership editing is not offered. Room discovery is durable on the gateway rather than replicated through Desktop `ui_meta`.
